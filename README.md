# ml-on-blockchain

## Simple behavior

### One server one worker

Goal of this first milestone is to deploy a smart contract on a local quorum blockchain.
The smart contract consists of a counter that can be incremented.
Once the smart contract is deployed, a worker willing to join the learning process should call this smart contract and
increment the counter by one (this will later on be used in order to add a worker to set of workers).
